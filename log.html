                <p>Feb. 19 | 21:58</p>
                <p>The anchored text on the sidebars allow users to jump directly to the content they wish to see. However, the header that is fixed to the top will block the content, forcing users to scroll a bit up. This was fixed by decreasing margin space and then re-adding them back as top padding. (Yes, top margin space can be negative.) Since the h5 elements had a background color, this didn't work. Therefore, a separate div element was created, along with a separate class dedicated towards giving the h5 elements ample space for anchored text to function.</p>
                
                <h6 id="2019-6">FIX | WEBSITE | Sidebar can scroll now </h6>
                <p>Feb. 19 | 21:30</p>
                <p>Knowing the sidebar will fill up with lots of links, a scrolling bar has been added. Now a scrollbar should appear on the sidebar if enough content is added to fill the sidebar. Additionally, this will cause the sidebar to have less room on the right side where the scrollbar will appear so extra margin on content inside the scrollbar was added.</p>
                
                <h6 id="2019-5">FIX | WEBSITE | Projects page, current tab </h6>
                <p>Feb. 19 | 20:31</p>
                <p>On the projects page, now on the header, now the current tab is displayed. The title of the tab matches and the on the navbar, PROJECTS is now shown as orange to indicate the current tab.</p>

                <p>The log/changes page has been created using the formatting found in the documentary. These will be announced with either of the following:</p>
                <p><span class="code">CREATE (CRE)</span> will represent the creation of something.</p>
                <p><span class="code">FIX (FIX)</span> will represent a bug fix or improvement in general.</p>
